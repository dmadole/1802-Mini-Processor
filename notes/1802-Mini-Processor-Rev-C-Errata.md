# 1802/Mini Processor Notes and Errata

I recommend changing the 47K resistors at R1-R7, R16, R17, and R19 on the 1802/Mini processor board to 4.7K to improve bus timing of open-drain signals at higher processor speeds. It takes approximately 600ms for the 47K pull-ups to bring a low signal back high after de-assertion and you will likely have difficulty running DMA at speeds over 2Mhz without this change as the signal will stretch into the next machine cycle.

Itâ€™s good enough to change just R2 and R3 for DMA but on new builds I recommend changing all 10 specified. As of Rev D of the board, the silkscreen has been updated to reflect this. There are no other changes in Rev D other than this cosmetic change.
